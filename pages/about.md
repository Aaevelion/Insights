# About

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Hi Everyone! My name is Ahmed Ayman(AKA:MR19HT) & I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer. Interested in Red Teaming and penetration testing. I participate in most CTF competitions. Sometimes I write articles about competitions and summarize technical topics, whether they are in the form of essays or mental maps, and all of this is available on my blog and GitHub. I worked on many software projects while studying computer engineering in different fields like digital image processing, software engineering, computer graphics, artificial intelligence and all those projects are on my GitHub.
